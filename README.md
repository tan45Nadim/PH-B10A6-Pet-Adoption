# Peddy - Your Path to Pet Adoption

Peddy is a pet adoption website designed to help individuals find their perfect pet companions. With a focus on making the pet adoption process seamless and informative, users can browse through various categories of animals and find detailed information about each pet available for adoption.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Pet Categories**: Users can filter pets based on categories such as dogs, cats, rabbits, and birds, with real-time loading of available animals.
2. **Pet Details and Adoption Process**: Each pet comes with detailed information including breed, age, gender, and vaccination status, allowing users to make informed decisions.
3. **Adoption Countdown**: Once a user chooses to adopt a pet, a countdown starts, confirming the initiation of the adoption process.
4. **Sorting by Price**: Users can sort pets by price in descending order to find the best deal for their new companion.
5. **Favorites Section**: Users can "like" pets and view their favorite pets in a separate section for easier comparison.

## ES6 Features Used

- **Arrow Functions**: Simplified function expressions are used across the project.
- **Template Literals**: HTML structures are dynamically created using template literals to inject content into the DOM.
- **Async/Await**: Asynchronous API calls for fetching data (e.g., pet categories, pet details) are handled using `async` and `await` for better code flow.
- **Destructuring Assignment**: Data fetched from APIs is destructured to extract and use specific properties directly.
